# To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
# Would you capture it or just let it slip?
# Yo

# [Verse 1]
# His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
# There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
# He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
# To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
# What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
# He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
# He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
# The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
# Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
# Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
# But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
# He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
# He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
# He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
# Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
# Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

# [Chorus]
# You better lose yourself in the music
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better

# His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
# This world is mine for the taking, make me king
# As we move toward a new world order
# A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
# Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
# Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
# These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
# He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
# God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
# He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
# But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
# These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
# They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
# He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
# Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
# But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

# [Chorus]
# You better lose yourself in the music
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better
# [Verse 3]
# No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
# Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
# I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
# I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
# But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
# Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
# All the pain inside amplified by the
# Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
# Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
# 'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
# And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
# And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
# Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
# Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
# Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
# Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
# To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
# To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
# Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
# Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
# To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
# So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
# This may be the only opportunity that I got

# [Chorus]
# You better lose yourself in the music
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better lose yourself in the music
# The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
# You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
# This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
# You better
